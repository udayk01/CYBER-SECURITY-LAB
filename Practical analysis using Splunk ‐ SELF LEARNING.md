# Using search
> Search option is used to search the incident log with time span. Limiting a search by time is a key to faster result and is a best pratice.

>> Commands that create statics and visualization are called transforming commands. We can share the share job log with other user it will remain active for 7 days, and every 10 min we need to refresh the log search. We can download the report in csv,xml,json.

# Exploring Events
> If we search the objects in filters by default the event will turn the list, filtered keyword would be highlighted and we can examine the logs with timespan.

>> Many Events actions filter will be available.

# Using search term In filters we can use terms of keywords. Eg. fail*, failed, FAILURE

>> search terms are not case sensitive and booleans also we can use Boolean operations have an order of evaluation a. NOT b. OR c. AND Note: parenthesis () should be used

# What are knowledge objects? 
> It is tools that help you discover and analyze the data, will be grouped in 5 categories . 

>> a. Data Interpretation 

>> b. Data classifications 

>> c. Data Enrichment 

>> d. Data Normalization 

>> e. Data Model 

> Knowledge object is use full for several reasons it can be create by one user and share with other user with permission granted. It is powerful tool for your deployment Data Interpretation - Fields
