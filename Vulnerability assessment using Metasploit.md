> We can see that there many services let's take any two and try to exploit it.

> First go with **vsftpd 2.3.4** lets search in metasploit database using the search command

> So there is exploit for this lets select that exploit

> After setting the host, running the command we were able to get root shell access into the metasploit system

> So we can see that we are in the target machine a we have full access
